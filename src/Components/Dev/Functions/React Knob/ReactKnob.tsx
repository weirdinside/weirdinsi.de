          React-Knob is a component that I am currently building, but initially
          developed for use on{" "}

          . It is not in use on the website at the moment, but was part of the
          of the initial audio player page design. However, I realized that the
          UX of a knob on a touch device was a bit funky and tossed the use case
          in the garbage, but have kept developing it for use on other projects.

        For fun, I also ran an experiment using LLMs to see how well they could
        understand and execute upon translating polar coordinates into radians
        for this project. As of March 2025, no LLM has been able to figure out
        the execution properly, despite getting the theory correct (even given
        detailed, guided prompts and several corrective prompts).
